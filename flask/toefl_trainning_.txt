EXAMPLE 1

The article introduces the topic of deforestation, which is the clearing and cutting down of trees in a large area. The writer says there are many benefits to deforestation. The lecturer disagrees. He says that deforestation has many consequences, and attacks each of the claims made in the reading.

First, the author says that cutting down trees creates farmlands now suitable for growing crops and raising livestock. The reading passage states that this provides more food for people and can benefit the economy. The professor believes there are flaws in the author’s position. He contends that it is not necessary to destroy rainforests for land to farm. He goes on to say that there are advanced technologies that allow for alternative ways to farm without soil.

According to the writer, clearing the areas also provides residential space for people to live and work in; a concern as the population continues to increase. The speaker, on the other hand, points out that deforestation displaces the animals from the forest and destroys the plants which provide us with oxygen. He feels that this long-term cost is not worth the money people can make from residential developments on the land.

Also, the reading passage notes how cutting down trees is necessary for creating lumber, paper and furniture, and that it is, therefore, an important source of income for many people. The professor rebuts this argument. He says that those who work in the wood cutting industry are actually paid very small wages. In fact, he claims deforestation does not benefit the workers at all, but rather the large company owners.

As you can see, the author and lecturer hold very different views on deforestation.


EXAMPLE 2

The article introduces the topic of alternative energy sources. More specifically, the writer discusses the advantages of wave farms, and how they are superior to all other options. The lecturer in the listening passage disagrees. He believes that each energy source has certain drawbacks and attacks each of the claims made in the reading. 

In the reading, the author begins by stating that wave farms do not negatively impact the environment in any way, unlike the burning of fossil fuels which damages the ozone layer. The lecturer, however, disagrees with this viewpoint. He states that wave farms also emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to operate. He goes on to say that dangerous chemicals are released into the ocean during the construction of wave farms.

The author also claims that what makes wave farms stand apart from other alternative energy sources, such as solar, is the predictability of waves and how they can provide a reliable amount of energy. Again, the lecturer believes there are flaws in the writer's argument. The speaker holds that wave energy is just as unstable as solar due to technical issues at the farms. Furthermore, harsh conditions can disrupt the process of the generators. 

Another reason why the author feels that wave farms are better is that they are environmentally friendly, not hurting animals as wind turbines often do. The professor in the listening passage is doubtful that this is accurate. He suggests that certain devices in the wave farm produce a loud sound which disturbs nearby birds and other marine life. Moreover, animals could become trapped or caught up in parts of the machines.

To sum up, both the writer and professor hold conflicting views about the be.


EXAMPLE 3

First of all, the author notes that nowadays we are more likely to find goods and services that perfectly meet our needs because there are many options in the marketplace.  This makes our lives easier and it means that we are not likely to regret our choices in life.  In contrast, the professor says that it can be extremely tiring to evaluate all of the options that are available.  He says that this can lead to a problem called “decision fatigue,” which refers to how it is harder to make good decisions as the day goes on.

Next, the article suggests that the availability of many choices leads to innovation in society.  Our tendency to always seek out newer and better options forces companies to produce better goods.  The professor also challenges this point.  He argues that in reality this just causes the marketplace to fill up with mediocre products.  Eventually, this may hinder the overall progress of society.

Finally, it is noted in the article that having many choices  increases our individual growth and development.  This is because we reflect on ourselves and our values when we consider what products to choose.  The professor challenges this argument by saying that this actually causes us to become complacent and lazy.  In fact, we may not seek out more options if we feel that everything we need is already available to us.  As a result, we achieve less success in our personal and professional lives.

EXAMPLE 4

The article and the lecture are both about olive trees and the bacteria that often infect them. Specifically, the author discusses methods to combat the bacteria and prevent infection, while the lecturer disagrees with most of these points and questions the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

First, the reading suggests that farmers should inspect olive trees regularly to detect signs of early infection and prevent the spread of the disease. The lecturer, however, challenges this idea. He argues that early detection is extremely difficult given the large number of trees. While it may be somewhat helpful, he emphasizes that inspections are not effective on a larger scale.

Second, the author recommends promoting the health of olive trees as a strategy to prevent bacterial infection. The lecturer again disagrees, stating that even healthy trees can still be infected. Therefore, maintaining tree health does not guarantee protection against the disease.
Finally, the passage proposes reducing the population of insects that transmit the bacteria, either by using natural predators such as ladybugs and lacewings or by applying pesticides. The professor, however, expresses doubts about this strategy as well. He explains that while natural predators may initially help, they can easily fly away from the infected areas, limiting their effectiveness. In addition, insecticides may work at first, but they are not reliable in the long term and thus cannot be considered a permanent solution.

In conclusion, the author of the article presents several methods to prevent bacterial infections in olive trees, but the lecturer argues that these approaches are largely ineffective. As a result, the two hold very different perspectives on how to protect olive trees from disease.

EXAMPLE 5

The article and the lecture are both about the Phoenicians. While the author of the article doubts that the Phoenicians sailed around Africa, the lecturer disagrees and argues against each of the author’s points.

First, the reading claims that Phoenician ships were not designed for long-distance voyages and were too limited to endure such a journey. However, the lecturer challenges this idea. He explains that the Phoenicians’ ships were well-equipped, durable, and capable of withstanding long travels. He also adds that the Phoenicians were highly skilled at maintaining their ships during extended voyages.

Second, the author argues that the voyage would have been extremely dangerous, especially around the Cape of Good Hope, which is difficult to navigate even in modern times. In contrast, the lecturer points out that the Phoenicians were expert sailors who used the stars for navigation and possessed extensive knowledge of geography. This, according to him, would have allowed them to handle such challenges successfully.

Finally, the passage states that there is no historical evidence of the Phoenicians’ journey and no records proving that they circumnavigated Africa. The lecturer refutes this argument by suggesting that Egyptian drawings provide evidence of Phoenician travels. He also notes that other ancient civilizations have records supporting the possibility of such voyages.

In conclusion, the author and the lecturer present very different perspectives on whether the Phoenicians sailed around Africa. The lecturer strongly disputes the author’s claims by providing historical, geographical, and technological counterarguments.

EXAMPLE 6

The article introduces the topic of ecotourism, a new form of tourism that supports the preservation of natural environments. More specifically, the writer discusses several benefits of ecotourism. In the listening passage, the lecturer is quick to point out that there are some serious flaws in the writer’s claims. In fact, the professor believes that ecotourism can actually be harmful and addresses, in detail, the trouble with each point made in the reading text.

In the reading, the author states that ecotourism generates revenue for environmental conservation and provides financial support to national parks, wildlife reserves, and other projects. The lecturer, however, disagrees with this viewpoint. He states that much of the money generated by ecotourism does not actually reach conservation efforts.
He goes on to say that the profits often end up in the hands of large companies instead of supporting local preservation.

The author also claims that ecotourism creates job opportunities and reduces the dependence of local economies on destructive industries. Again, the lecturer believes there are flaws in the writer's argument. He specifically addresses this point when he states that many of these jobs are low-paying and seasonal, meaning they cannot provide reliable, year-round employment. He further argues that ecotourism actually increases economic dependence on outside tourism, making local communities vulnerable.


Finally, the author brings his argument to a close by suggesting that ecotourism helps promote environmental education and awareness. The professor in the listening passage is doubtful that it is accurate. He points out that many tourists leave behind waste and that constant human interaction disturbs wildlife, altering their natural behavior and leading to long-term harm and habitat destruction.

To sum up, both the writer and professor hold conflicting views about ecotourism.
It's clear that they will have trouble finding common ground on this issue.

EXAMPLE 1 (ACADEMIC)

Many people hold different opinions on what exactly makes art so important on a social and individual level. I firmly believe that art is for much more than entertainment. Susana touched on this already, but some people devote their entire lives to learning an art form like music. A world-class violinist not only plays the violin for entertainment but finds purpose in her life through tinkering and getting better at the violin over time. While I do understand Alex's point, I believe he is missing the broader context. Art is not only confined to the movies we watch or the books we read, but it applies to painting, sculpture, poetry, woodworking, and other less popular pursuits. As you can see, these disciplines not only entertain audiences but provide meaning to the artist's lives and inspiration to their viewers. 

EXAMPLE 2 (ACADEMIC)

Remote work has become a hot topic, especially since the spread of the Coronavirus. Personally speaking, I prefer to work at home. I have worked in offices before, and, unfortunately, it almost always devolves into an environment where everyone thinks the same way. I remember when I worked at a school in midtown Manhattan and the entire staff was afraid of getting fired, so no one dissented from the school president’s opinion, even though he was a tyrant. However, I have to admit that Sam makes a good point. It is much harder to form strong bonds with people who do not share the same physical space. I have tried at my current job from my home office, and Zoom meetups are just not enough to get close to someone. Still, if I had to choose, I would opt for the freedom of working from home.
